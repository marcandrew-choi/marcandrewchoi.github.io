## Biography

I am a fourth year undergraduate student at UCLA studying mathematics with a Specialization in Computing. My research topics are applications to Nonlinear Systems of Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (preferably in mathematical biology and social sciences). After graduation, I plan on getting my PhD in Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics at the University of Michigan. On my free time, I enjoy keeping up with the NBA, cooking food and playing piano. Feel free to reach me at inhyak \[at\] ucla \[dot\] edu
