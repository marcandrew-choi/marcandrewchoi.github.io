<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I wish I could provide a list of things that any undergraduates can do to get into a top tier PhD program, but admissions can be hard to predict and every situation is hard to generalize. However, these things can definitely increase your chances to admission. Although my experiences are in Applied Mathematics, I believe many of these tips can be generalized to any field. Finally, I did my undergraduate degree at UCLA so this advice will rely on US’s GPA system (/4.0) and opportunities.</p>
<section id="what-is-a-phd-program" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-phd-program">What is a PhD program?</h2>
<p>A PhD program is the academic program consisting of academic coursework and research. Research is the biggest emphasis of the degree. As a result, PhD students are required to conduct original research, known as a dissertation, that expands the boundaries of knowledge dissertation. To demonstrate their mastery, students must defend their work to a panel of other experts in the field. These programs tend to last anywhere from 3-8 years (typically 4-5 years depending on the subject area).</p>
</section>
<section id="why-should-you-not-get-a-phd" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-should-you-not-get-a-phd">Why should you NOT get a PhD?</h2>
<p>Even though a PhD is one of the most prestigous degrees in academia, simply having the title of Dr.&nbsp;Last Name is not a good reason to pursue one. Unlike Bachelor’s degrees, the focus of a PhD program is research and not coursework. Although some people enjoy research, many of my colleagues were strong students but did not enjoy research. Additionally, the opportunity cost of obtaining a PhD is very high.Although the normative time to graduate is roughly five years, it is not uncommon for people to take six years. Most of my colleagues with my same major entered industry right away with jobs ranging from 60k-200k out of undergrad. In contrast, most PhD students will make somewhere between 20k-35k a year for the next five years. Depending on where you live, this is barely a liveable wage and few PhD students have the resources to do recreational activities such as travel, go to concerts, etc.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-should-you-get-a-phd" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-should-you-get-a-phd">Why should you get a PhD?</h2>
<p>Yes, PhD programs can be brutal but there are numerous opportunities post grad. For example, a PhD is required to be a researcher or faculty member at an institution. If academia is not your style, many people pivot and work in industry as a researcher or in higher roles with greater pay. This may especially make sense if the job market is really bad and you want to be a researcher at, for example, a tech company. Finally, some jobs, such a quantative researcher, require a PhD.</p>

<section id="what-to-do-during-undergrad" class="level1">
<h1>What to do during undergrad</h1>
<section id="introduction-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>College is a great way to grow personally, socially and professionally. I have changed my career desires about 3-4 times during my college career. I would highly recommend students to dip their toes in various fields and see which fields resonate with them the most. However, if you are deadset on getting a PhD, it is best to determine this as soon as possible to stack your resume as soon as possible. In this section, I will discuss what you can do in each year of an undergraduate degree to maximize your chances to get into a PhD program.</p>
</section>
<section id="first-year" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-year">First year</h2>
<p>In your first year, I would focus on primarily getting good grades. Transitioning to college can be a major challenge to students; many of my friends were straight A students in high school but received multiple Bs and sometimes Cs in college. GPA is one of the most important factors of PhD admissions and geting off to a great start will set you up for success later. One of my biggest weaknesses in my application is my first year grades. I received a B in Discrete Mathematics and a B- in Linear Algebra, the latter being arguably the most important math classes. Even though these are grades are not terrible, you want to minimize Bs as much as possible.</p>
<p>If you are doing well in school, I suggest trying to take multiple math classes or more advanced classes per quarter. I start taking one math class a quarter but eventually took up to five courses in a quarter. Honors classes are a great way to show PhD admissions that you are serious about your academics. Sometimes, an A- in an honors class is more impressive than an A in a regular class. The first term is a great way to determine the attention needed per class, so I would highly recommend only turning up the academic rigor after the first term.</p>
<p>At this point, most students do not have enough mathematics to get involved in research. I did not start research until my third year of undergrad. To show interest outside of the classroom, I would recommend Directed Reading Programs (DRP) if your school offers it. Typically, DRPs are mentorships between undergraduate students with graduate students where students work on independent study projects such as reading textbooks. This is a great way to meet graduate students in a more intimate setting where you can ask about the life of a PhD student. This is a great opportunity to truly assess whether or not the PhD path is right for you. An alternative to DRPs is to ask graduate students or professors to read through a textbook together.</p>
<p>If you are an advanced student and have taken an upper division course in Linear Algebra or Real Analysis (Advanced Calculus), you might be able to participate in research your freshman year. Jump to the second and third year sections for more information.</p>
</section>
<section id="second-year" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="second-year">Second Year</h2>
<p>Second year is pretty similar to first year except with harder classes. Students should start taking upper division classes and start to get a sense of which subareas in mathematics they prefer over others. For instance, during my second year, I learned I did not like pure math such as algebra and prefered other areas such as Differential Equations. With ample course work, students can start doing research with professors at their universities.</p>
<p>I am often asked how to get a research opportunity. I suggest identifying which professors you would want to work with, reading a few of their papers and emailing them with interest. The success rate of this is not the highest since many professors are already busy with their own research and graduate students. However, I was able to get my first research opportunity this way, so just because some professors do not have time or ghost you, I would continue to try.</p>
<p>You can also start looking into Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs) during this year. Most participants of these programs are typically third years but I also know a few second years who participate. REUs are arguably more competitive than PhD applications since countless PhD applicants apply without research experience, yet most REU students apply to PhD programs. REU applications typically consist of a personal statement and letters of recommendation.</p>
<p>Second year is a great opportunity to get to know your professors so they can write a strong letter of recommendation. The best way to build a positive relationship with your professors are to go to office hours and ask questions. Especially in very large classes, this, and participating in class, are the best ways to stand out from your peers.</p>
<p>Some miscellaneous things that could help your application are being a learning/teaching assistant or a tutor. These are all dependent on your institution, but since most graduate students are expected to teach, this is a great way to get experience.</p>
</section>
<section id="third-year" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="third-year">Third Year</h2>
<p>Just like high school, your third year is your most important. Academically, I would start looking into take very advanced classes such as graduate classes. Although many PhD applicants apply without research, I would argue that your potential is capped without it. For research during the school year, read the second year section.</p>
<p>Since doing a REU during the summer after your third year is very important, I will spend majority of this section discussing the specifics of applications. For REUs, I would highly reaching different REUs and seeing topics sound most interesting. REUs are typically paid research (around $3000-$7000 depending on the institution) where students are expected to conduct research for 8-12 weeks for 40 hours a week. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mathreu">This link</a>] is a great place to start your search. Most applications are available around early January and deadlines are January-March. You should receive the offer or a rejection around February-April. There are some institution that will never give you a response for a rejection so I would recommend around April to check in with institutions to see if they are still deliberating on decisions. REU applications are mostly free. As a result, students might initially want to apply to as many as possible. Although this is theoretically possible, each requires application requires an essay and two letters of recommendation. These professors may be a bit annoyed or even not write a letter if you apply to too many places. Typically, 8-12 programs is typical. For the essay of these programs, I would split it up into three main sections. First, I would discuss your prior experience (such as coursework and research) and your curiosity for mathematics. Next, I would discuss your interest in the program and talking about your specific interest about some of the concepts covered. Finally, I would discuss your interest in graduate school in the future (a short section). I would avoid talking about how much you loved math as a kid and only talk about your experiences as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>REU programs are very competitive and don’t worry too much if you get no acceptances. Worst case scenario, I would look into internships or other research opportunities.</p>
</section>
<section id="fourth-year-application-season" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fourth-year-application-season">Fourth Year / Application Season</h2>
<p>So after the last three years of undergrad, you really are serious about applying to PhD programs. First, I would start identifying which grad schools you want to apply to. Unlike REU programs, graduate schools have application fees that can range between $75-150. As a result, there may be financial obstacles that ultimately determine how many programs you can apply to. Typically, a safe number of places to apply to is 8-12.</p>
<p>Hopefully by this point, you have a general idea what you want to work with. A good place to start is asking various professors in that specific field (preferably letter of recommendation writers) who what are possible programs that you can look into. This also might increase your chances since connections are very important in admissions. Things you also may want to consider is location, program, qualification exam difficulty, and funding.</p>
<p>Qualification exams are exams taken in the first two years of a PhD program to make sure you are up to university standards. These exams are a major source of stress for most students. Even though you may be interested in a certain area, a university may require a qualification exam pass in a completely different area. For instance, Princeton requires Applied Math PhD students to pass an Algebra Qualification Exam, a subset of math very different than applied math.</p>
<p>This part is optional but can help in the long run. I would start researching which faculty members you may want to work with, given you are admitted in that university. You can email these professors and get a feel for their research and their overall</p>
<p>Once you finalized your list of graduate schools, create a list of application deadlines. This will help you stay on track start to identify your letter of recommendation writers and ask them at minimum of a month before your first deadline.</p>
<p>At this point in the process, the only things you can realistically control is your statement of purpose. Your GPA is a cumulation of the previous three years (and typically due dates are before the end of the first term of your fourth year), your letters of recommendation are all determined by your professors, and unless you are finishing up research projects, hopefully you have accrued research experience in some way these past three years. A statement of purpose is typically 500-1000 words consisting of your experiences and desires. A general structure for this statement of purpose is an introduction stating your experience, why that particular program resonates with you and the faculty you want to work with, and your long term goals. The more specific you can be, the better. For instance, when I wrote my statement of purpose, I would discuss specific papers that the faculty members I was interested wrote and discussed what interested me and how I could incorporate it with my research area. In general, I would highly avoid reading samples of statement of purposes because it could detract from your voice. The statement of purposes can be generally the same across universities and differ only on the university specific parts.</p>
</section>
<section id="so-you-got-an-acceptance-now-what" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-you-got-an-acceptance-now-what">So you got an acceptance, now what?</h2>
<p>Congratulations! Treat yourself! PhD acceptances are a big deal. If possible, visit the institution during the open house and get to know your cohort, current graduate students and faculty. Most programs should be willing to pay for travel (up to a certian amount) so this should be somewhat accessible. In the event you are unable to visit, I would independently start reaching out to graduate students and faculty to get more information about the program. You will be spending the next five years here so it is imperative to be confident in your decision. If you are having trouble deciding, make a pros and cons list or talk to your letter of recommendation writers for their input. Also, if you are a student at a larger university, ask faculty who received their PhD from their institutions for their thoughts. Hopefully through this dialogue, you are able to make an informed decision.</p>
</section>
<section id="so-you-werent-successful-what-else-can-i-do" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-you-werent-successful-what-else-can-i-do">So you weren’t successful, what else can I do?</h2>
<p>It is completely okay to take a day or two and feel sad about this outcome. Admissions can be really hard and most programs have less than a 15% acceptance rate. If you want to explore other career paths first, I would highly recommend recruiting for those industries. However, if you are deadset on getting a PhD, I would identify your weaknesses in your application and improve them. Typically, there are two main options you can do. First, you can apply to MS programs to get more research and advanced coursework under your belt. The biggest con here is that most MS programs are unfunded so tuition will come out of your wallet. Another option is you can reach out to various faculty and try to be a full time researchers assistant. Hopefully you can get a publication out of this, a stronger letter of recommendation and a clearer idea of what where to apply to.</p>
